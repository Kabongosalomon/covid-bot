In times of crisis, misinformation runs rampant. While the coronavirus outbreak of 2019 was essential in highlighting the healthcare system's inability to deal with global epidemics, it also served to underscore the infodemic at its root, or the inability of governing bodies and healthcare institutions to communicate clear and accurate information at scale. By deploying a chatbot on a cross-platform messaging application, we attempt show how to mitigate the dissemination of misinformation using recent advances in natural-language processing.

**The following Colab notebook shows you how to quickly get started with a simple model that answers questions about Covid-19.
While NLP can be used to combat misinformation, it can also be used for less admirable purposes and fear mongering. As such, the code for social media deployment is not provided in order to mitigate the potential spread of misinformation. We do recommend moral introspection and caution should you choose to do so.**
